👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open-source backend projects that focus on APIs, automation, or data systems.  
- ML integration in everyday apps — turning theory into useful features.

 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Deploying containerized ML models efficiently.  
- Optimizing database performance in high-traffic backend systems.

💬 Ask me about
- REST API design, Flask/Django development, and backend logic.
